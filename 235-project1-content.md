# Proposal
## I. High Concept
It's your average space shooter... but if you don't actively destroy the enemies, you'll run out of time and the 
vacuum chamber will be completed, causing you to lose the game. 
## II. Genre
Top-Down Space Shooter
## III. Platform
Desktop Only
## IV. Story
The evil organization AndroCorp has started to build a vacuum chamber around the galaxy. Their goal is to eliminate all life in the galaxy, 
so they can go through uncontested and harvest the resources of each planet, one by one. The united force of Star Patrol goes against 
AndroCorp's evil plans. The goal of the player is simple, as a member of Star Patrol, you must stop AndroCorp and destroy their 
vacuum chamber before they can complete it. The player will travel through level in standard top-down shooter format, 
destroying key parts of the vacuum chamber until the face off with the head of AndroCorp. 
## V. Aesthetics
The art-stlye is rather cartoonish, in order to highlight the ridiculousness of AndroCorp and Star Patrol. The tone of the game 
will be suitably cartoonish, while the stakes are high, both of the main organizations are over the top in nature. 
The sound will be in an 8-bit fashion, with a looped soundtrack for each level. Sounds for the game will be standard explosions 
for defeated enemies, along with blaster sounds for fired shots. UI will be basic elements displaying score, remaining lives, and 
the time limit for the stage. 
## VI. Gameplay
### Controls
Vacuum Chamber uses standard Arrow Keys movement, with the spacebar being used for firing shots. 
Below the game window will have the controls for player convinience and ease of access. 
### Mechanics
Defeating enemies in Vacuum Chamber is key, because each enemy you defeat is one less worker to work on the vacuum chamber. 
Each level has a timer starting with one minute. While you could dodge enemies, you'd lose when the timer runs down to zero, 
as the enemies escape and work on the chamber. Defeating enemies adds time to the timer, and so it's key to defeat enemies to 
avoid running out of time. You do this throughout the level until all enemies have left or are destroyed.

## VIII. Developer
My name is Diony Severino, developer of Vacuum Chamber. I'm a sophomore Game Design and Development Major who always enjoyed Space Shooters, 
from the originals like Galaga, to some of the more extreme ones like Touhou. My forte is in programming, specifically in Java, C#, and C++. 
I've always wanted to try my hand at creating a space shooter, and see if I could manage to make one 
as fun as the ones I've played. I look forward to seeing how everyone enjoys Vacuum Chamber!
